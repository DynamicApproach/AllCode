# AllCode
A collection of code I've written in the past, some for school, some for home and some for no reason at all.

Some of this was written during my earliest learning periods of coding. Some of it is more recent. 

My main projects are currently private and some are partially in development but most of the code in this repository is complete. 

Feel free to ask questions or raise issues, I'd be happy to go back through. I tend to leave a lot of comments, especially while developing and most
things can be understood through those comments.  

I hope you find something that helps you.
